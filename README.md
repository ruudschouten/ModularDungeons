# ModularDungeons

This tool can be used to generate procedural dungeons. 

## Installing

Clone or download the repo and copy `3rd Party`, `Scripts`, `Prefabs`, `Materials` and `Texture` folder to your preferred Unity project. 
You can simply drop in the `Dungeon Generator` prefab, or extend the `DungeonGenerator` class and add features of your own.

## Usage

If you enable the `Generate on Awake` options in the Inspector, a dungeon will be generated when you start your project. 
You can also call `Generate` method in the `DungeonGenerator` class.
